# AI Agent Comparison

This repository contains a curated list of AI agents, categorized and profiled to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape. The goal of this project is to offer a structured and detailed comparison of various AI agents, focusing on their features, capabilities, and benchmarks.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`agents.json`**: This file contains the structured data for all the profiled AI agents. It is the single source of truth for the information presented in this repository.

- **`agents/`**: This directory contains individual profiles for each AI agent. Each agent has its own subdirectory, which includes a `profile.md` file.

- **`profile.md`**: Each `profile.md` file provides a human-readable summary of the corresponding agent's data from `agents.json`.

- **`VISION.md`**: This document outlines the long-term vision for this project, including plans for automated research and report generation.
