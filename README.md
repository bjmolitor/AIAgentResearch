# Project: AI Agent Benchmarking

This document outlines the vision and research plan for creating a comprehensive benchmarking platform for various AI agents.

## Vision: The AI Agent Benchmarking Page

The goal is to create a dynamic, comprehensive, and user-friendly web page that serves as the go-to resource for comparing AI agents.

### 1. Structure and Categories

The page will be structured around the distinct categories of AI agents. The primary navigation will allow users to filter by:

*   **Terminal-Based Agents:** Standalone command-line tools (e.g., Claude Code, Gemini CLI).
*   **IDE-Embedded Agents:** Extensions within an Integrated Development Environment (e.g., Roo Code, Cursor).
*   **Web & Virtualized Agents:** Agents with web interfaces and/or their own virtualized environments (e.g., Jules, Devin).
*   **Agent Frameworks:** Libraries for building multi-agent systems (e.g., CrewAI, LangChain).

### 2. Data Points for Each Agent

For each agent, the page will display a "card" with the following information:

*   **Basic Info:** Name, Logo, Website, Developer/Company.
*   **Key Features:** A list of standout features (e.g., "Virtual Filesystem", "Web Browsing Capability", "Self-Correction Loop").
*   **Supported Models:** The underlying LLMs the agent can use (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro).
*   **Pricing:** A summary of the pricing model (e.g., Free, Freemium, Subscription, Pay-per-use).
*   **Quantitative Benchmarks:**
    *   **SWE-Bench Score:** Performance on the Software Engineering Benchmark.
    *   **Task Success Rate:** A custom metric for non-coding tasks (e.g., "Successfully summarized the provided URL").
    *   **Resource Usage:** Average CPU/RAM usage where applicable.
*   **Qualitative Assessment:**
    *   **Ease of Use:** A rating (1-5 stars) and a short summary.
    *   **Documentation Quality:** A rating and summary.
    *   **Onboarding Experience:** How easy is it for a new user to get started?

### 3. Interactive Features

*   **Dynamic Filtering:** Users can filter the list of agents by category, supported models, pricing, and features.
*   **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Users can select 2-4 agents to view their data points in a detailed, side-by-side table.
*   **"Best for..." Tags:** Curated tags to help users find the right tool for their needs (e.g., "Best for Beginners", "Best for Complex Automation", "Best for Data Analysis").

### 4. Exportability

The platform will support exporting the data in multiple formats:

*   **CSV/JSON:** For raw data analysis.
*   **PDF:** A printable, well-formatted report of the current view (or a full report).
*   **Markdown:** For easy embedding into other documents or websites.

## Research Project: A Multi-Step Outline

This research project is designed to systematically collect, analyze, and present the data for the benchmarking page.

### Phase 1: Scoping and Schema Definition (1 week)

1.  **Finalize Agent List:** Create an exhaustive list of agents within each category to be included in the initial launch.
2.  **Define Data Schema:** Formalize the data points from the "Vision" section into a structured schema (e.g., a JSON schema). This ensures consistency.
3.  **Initial Information Gathering:** Collect all publicly available information (websites, pricing, features) for the listed agents and populate the dataset.

### Phase 2: Benchmark Definition and Tooling (2 weeks)

1.  **Evaluate SWE-Bench:** Deeply analyze SWE-Bench. Define a clear, repeatable process for running a specific subset of SWE-Bench tasks against applicable agents (Terminal and IDE-based). Document the exact commands and environment setup.
2.  **Develop Custom Benchmarks:** For agents where SWE-Bench is not a good fit (Web Agents, Frameworks), define a set of 3-5 standardized "real-world" tasks.
    *   *Example Task for Web Agent:* "Research the top 3 AI papers from NeurIPS 2023, summarize them, and save the summaries to a file."
    *   *Example Task for Framework:* "Build a simple two-agent system (researcher, writer) to create a blog post about a given topic."
3.  **Create Evaluation Scripts:** Develop scripts to automate the execution and scoring of these benchmarks wherever possible.

### Phase 3: Data Collection and Execution (4-6 weeks)

1.  **Execute SWE-Bench:** Systematically run the defined SWE-Bench tasks on all relevant agents. Record results, logs, and resource usage.
2.  **Execute Custom Benchmarks:** Run the custom tasks on the remaining agents and frameworks. Score the results based on a pre-defined rubric (e.g., accuracy, completeness, efficiency).
3.  **Conduct Qualitative Analysis:** For each agent, have at least two researchers independently assess and score the qualitative aspects (Ease of Use, Documentation) to reduce bias.

### Phase 4: Data Analysis and Content Creation (2 weeks)

1.  **Synthesize Results:** Aggregate all benchmark scores and qualitative data into the master dataset.
2.  **Generate Insights:** Analyze the data to identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses across categories and individual agents.
3.  **Write Summaries:** Write the qualitative summaries and assign the "Best for..." tags based on the synthesized data.

### Phase 5: Platform Development and Launch (3 weeks)

1.  **Develop Frontend:** Build the interactive web page based on the vision.
2.  **Integrate Data:** Connect the frontend to the master dataset.
3.  **Implement Exporters:** Build the functionality to export data into CSV, JSON, PDF, and Markdown.
4.  **Launch:** Deploy the website.

### Phase 6: Maintenance and Community Engagement (Ongoing)

1.  **Update Cycle:** Establish a quarterly review cycle to update agent data and add new agents.
2.  **Community Contributions:** Create a clear process for the community to suggest new agents or corrections to the data.

This structured approach ensures that the final benchmarking page is not just a list, but a valuable, data-driven tool for the entire AI development community.

I am ready for the next step.
