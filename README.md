# Open AI Agent Research ([MIT licensed â€“ contributors wanted.](https://github.com/bjmolitor/AIAgentResearch))

This repository contains a curated list of AI agents, categorized and profiled to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape. The goal of this project is to offer a structured and detailed comparison of various AI agents, focusing on their features, capabilities, and benchmarks.

## We're live!

You can browse the results of this research on our website: [https://aiagentresearch.netlify.app/](https://aiagentresearch.netlify.app/)

The website provides a comprehensive overview of the AI agents that have been profiled. It features:

*   **An Agent Leaderboard:** A table view of all the agents, with key information such as their category, benchmarks, and a link to their homepage.
*   **Detailed Agent Pages:** Clicking on an agent's name opens a detailed view with more information about the agent, including its key features, supported models, and persona ratings.
*   **Persona-Based Recommendations:** A "Can you recommend something?" feature that helps users find the best agent for their needs based on their user persona.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`agents/`**: This directory contains individual folders for each AI agent. Every folder includes an `agent_<name>.json` file with structured data about the agent, a `profile.md` with a human-readable summary, and a `persona_ratings_<name>.json` file with the agent's ratings for different user personas.

- **`website/`**: This directory contains the source code for the project's website. The website is a React application that displays the data from the `agents/` directory in a user-friendly way. It also includes the consolidated JSON files that are used to populate the website.

- **`VISION.md`**: This document outlines the long-term vision for this project.
