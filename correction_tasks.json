    "task_description": "Resolve inconsistent directory naming and merge duplicate agent data. There are several agent directories that are duplicated with different casing. For example, 'Android_Studio_Bot' and 'android_studio_bot'. The content of these directories is often different, with one being more up-to-date. The task is to identify the correct and most current version of each duplicated agent, merge any unique information, and remove the obsolete directory.",
    "relevant_files": [
      "agents/Android_Studio_Bot/",

    ],
    "reason": "Duplicate and inconsistent directories make the repository confusing to navigate and maintain. It can lead to contributors updating the wrong files, and it creates uncertainty about which data is canonical.",
    "risk": "There is a risk of data loss if the merge is not done carefully. The more up-to-date information must be correctly identified and preserved. There's also a risk of breaking any scripts or processes that might be relying on the old paths, although this is unlikely in this repository."

    "task_description": "Standardize the naming of JSON files. The file 'agents/google_vertex_ai_engine/agents_google_vertex_ai_engine.json' is named with a plural 'agents' but contains data for a single agent. It should be renamed to 'agent_google_vertex_ai_engine.json' to be consistent with other agent data files. Similarly, there are inconsistencies in persona rating file names that need to be standardized.",
    "relevant_files": [
      "agents/google_vertex_ai_engine/agents_google_vertex_ai_engine.json",
      "agents/v0.app/persona_ratings_v0.json",

    "reason": "Consistent naming conventions are crucial for maintainability and for programmatic processing of these files. Inconsistent names can lead to errors in scripts that process this data.",
    "risk": "Low. The main risk is that any code referencing the old filenames will break. A search for the old filenames should be conducted to update any references."

    "task_description": "Complete missing data in persona ratings. The file 'agents/AskCodi/persona_ratings_askcodi.json' has 'Research to be done.' as a placeholder for all 'reasoning' fields. This data needs to be researched and filled in to provide a complete and useful dataset.",

    "reason": "The dataset is incomplete and therefore not as useful as it could be. Missing data can mislead users or automated analyses of the data.",

  {
    "task_description": "Remove unused or temporary files. Files like 'agents/Jules/test.json', 'agents/Sourcegraph_Cody/test_file.txt', and 'website/public/vite.svg' appear to be temporary or boilerplate files that are not used in the project. They should be removed to clean up the repository.",

    "task_description": "Fix casing of enginelabs and its persona_ratings_engine.json file. The directory `agents/enginelabs/` and its `persona_ratings_engine.json` file have inconsistent casing.
