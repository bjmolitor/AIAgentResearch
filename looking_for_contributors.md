## Created a page for orientation in the world of AI agents - Looking for contributors

Hey folks,

I've been working on **Open AI Agent Research**, an overview hub. It's basically a link collection with some explanations and homogenous ratings trying to recommend agentic solutions best-suited for specific personas or use-cases.
 
The project is open-source and free for anyone to browse, fork, or build on.

That said, keeping research current is a big job. New tools pop up every week, and one person can't keep up alone. That's why this repo has been opened to the community.

### How you can help
- Share new agent solutions you come across.
- Improve descriptions.
- Criticize ratings.
- Open issues or PRs when you spot something out of date.
- Join the discussion and help plan the roadmap.
- Request or implement new features.

If you're excited about the future of AI agents, I'd love to have you on board. Visit the repo, leave feedback, and jump into the work.

As said, it's free and open source with no monetization planned. Just created this page because I needed it and couldn't find something like it.

Here's the page to look at: [https://aiagentresearch.netlify.app/](https://aiagentresearch.netlify.app/)

The link above is for my deployment of the repo [https://github.com/bjmolitor/AIAgentResearch](https://github.com/bjmolitor/AIAgentResearch)

Looking forward to feedback in the comments.
