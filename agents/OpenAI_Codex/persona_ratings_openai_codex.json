{
  "automation_productivity": {
    "rating": 4,
    "reasoning": "Codex accelerates day-to-day programming by drafting functions, refactoring code, and supplying context-aware suggestions that reduce manual typing, though integration with external build tools still requires user guidance."
  },
  "beginner_friendly_onboarding": {
    "rating": 5,
    "reasoning": "It runs entirely in the ChatGPT interface—no installations or configurations—and the conversational flow allows newcomers to ask for clarifications or examples as they learn."
  },
  "code_quality_testing": {
    "rating": 3,
    "reasoning": "Codex can generate unit tests, reason about edge cases, and execute small snippets in a sandbox to verify outputs, but cannot run full project test suites or guarantee correctness."
  },
  "codebase_comprehension": {
    "rating": 4,
    "reasoning": "The model explains pasted code, tracks context across a session, and suggests architectural improvements, although it lacks direct, large-scale repository indexing."
  },
  "creative_multimodal_exploration": {
    "rating": 3,
    "reasoning": "While primarily text-based, Codex can produce visualizations or diagrams by generating code that renders charts or HTML, offering limited multimodal support."
  },
  "data_experimental_flexibility": {
    "rating": 3,
    "reasoning": "Using the built-in sandbox, Codex can run data analysis scripts and iterate on experiments, but it does not manage datasets or experiment tracking outside the chat."
  },
  "visual_no_code_development": {
    "rating": 3,
    "reasoning": "Natural-language prompts reduce the need for manual coding and can scaffold simple interfaces, yet there is no true drag-and-drop builder."
  },
  "workflow_agent_orchestration": {
    "rating": 2,
    "reasoning": "Codex can call APIs or shell commands within the sandbox and produce scripts that automate tasks, but it lacks native orchestration of multiple external agents."
  }
}
