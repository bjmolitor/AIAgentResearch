  "automation_productivity": {
    "rating": 5,
    "reasoning": "Gemini CLI is designed for automation and productivity in the terminal. It can run non-interactively in scripts, automate operational tasks, and integrates with GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows like automated PR reviews and issue triage [1]. Its built-in tools for file system operations, shell commands, and web fetching further enhance its automation capabilities [2]."
  },
  "beginner_friendly_onboarding": {
    "rating": 4,
    "reasoning": "The onboarding process is streamlined for a developer tool. Installation is straightforward via npx, npm, or Homebrew [1]. The OAuth login option removes the need to manage API keys, and the generous free tier (60 requests/min, 1,000/day) makes it highly accessible [1]. While the documentation is extensive, the CLI nature might present a slight learning curve for absolute beginners compared to GUI tools."
  },
  "code_quality_testing": {
    "rating": 4,
    "reasoning": "The tool offers strong support for improving code quality. The documentation highlights use cases like 'improving test coverage' and 'debugging issues' [1]. The integration with GitHub Actions for automated pull request reviews provides a direct mechanism for maintaining code standards and catching issues early in the development process [2]."
  },
  "codebase_comprehension": {
    "rating": 5,
    "reasoning": "This is a core strength of Gemini CLI. It is explicitly designed to 'query and edit large codebases' [1]. It leverages the powerful Gemini 1.5 Pro model with a 1M token context window, and supports project-specific context through `GEMINI.md` files, enabling a deep understanding of a project's architecture and code [1, 2]."
  },
  "creative_multimodal_exploration": {
    "rating": 4,
    "reasoning": "For a command-line tool, Gemini CLI has impressive multimodal capabilities. It can generate applications from images and sketches [1]. Its extensibility via MCP servers allows it to connect to other generative models for images (Imagen), video (Veo), and audio (Lyria), which opens up a wide range of possibilities for creative, multimodal exploration [2]."
  },
  "data_experimental_flexibility": {
    "rating": 4,
    "reasoning": "Gemini CLI provides significant flexibility for data-related tasks. It can be extended via MCP servers to connect to custom data sources, including databases [1]. Its ability to process various inputs, such as PDFs and images, for application generation demonstrates its flexibility in handling different data types [2]. While not a specialized data science tool, its powerful coding and automation features make it adaptable for data experimentation."
  },
  "visual_no_code_development": {
    "rating": 1,
    "reasoning": "Gemini CLI is a terminal-based tool aimed at developers. It does not offer any features for visual or no-code development, such as a drag-and-drop interface or pre-built UI components. Its entire workflow is centered around the command line."
  },
  "workflow_agent_orchestration": {
    "rating": 5,
    "reasoning": "This is a key feature of Gemini CLI. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is specifically designed for creating custom integrations and orchestrating complex workflows by connecting to various tools and APIs [1]. The tool's 'reason and act' loop, combined with its ability to be used in scripts and GitHub Actions, makes it a powerful agent for composing and automating multi-step processes [2]."
