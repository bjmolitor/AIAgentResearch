# Gemini CLI

## Overview

The Gemini command line interface (CLI) is an open-source AI agent developed by Google that provides access to Gemini directly in your terminal. It uses a reason and act (ReAct) loop with your built-in tools and local or remote MCP servers to complete complex use cases like fixing bugs, creating new features, and improving test coverage. While the Gemini CLI excels at coding, it's also a versatile local utility that you can use for a wide range of tasks, from content generation and problem-solving to deep research and task management.
