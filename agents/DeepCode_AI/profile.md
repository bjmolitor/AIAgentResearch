# DeepCode AI

## Overview

DeepCode AI, developed by Snyk, is a powerful tool for automated code review, emphasizing static application security testing (SAST). It uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze your code repositories and identifies security vulnerabilities and quality issues by scanning code in real-time.

The service combines symbolic analysis with generative models and Snyk's vast vulnerability database to highlight insecure patterns, prioritize fixes by risk, and even suggest automated remediation where possible. Developers can catch issues before merging and maintain secure coding practices across projects.
