# DeepCode AI

## Overview

DeepCode AI, developed by Snyk, is a powerful tool for automated code review, emphasizing static application security testing (SAST). It uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze your code repositories and identifies security vulnerabilities and quality issues by scanning code in real-time.

## Key Information

- **Developer:** Snyk
- **Website:** [https://snyk.io/platform/deepcode-ai/](https://snyk.io/platform/deepcode-ai/)
- **Pricing:** Tiered (Free, Team, Enterprise). Team plan starts at $25/month.

## Key Features

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Examines static source code to detect flaws that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
- **Snyk integration:** Accesses a broad database of known security issues.
- **Code analysis:** Parses code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) for precise issue detection.
- **Security vulnerability detection:** Identifies security risks like SQL injection.
- **Code quality checks:** Flags redundant code and other quality issues.
