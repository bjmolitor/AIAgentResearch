  "automation_productivity": {
    "rating": 5,
    "reasoning": "ACT-1 is explicitly designed to execute multi-step computer tasks on behalf of the user, turning natural language instructions into actions across software. Its focus on automating routine workflows makes it highly oriented toward productivity."
  },
  "beginner_friendly_onboarding": {
    "rating": 2,
    "reasoning": "The system is not publicly available and currently requires joining a waitlist, so there is limited documentation or guided onboarding for new users."
  },
  "codebase_comprehension": {
    "rating": 1,
    "reasoning": "ACT-1 targets general computer operation rather than reading or understanding source code."
  },
  "code_quality_testing": {
    "rating": 1,
    "reasoning": "The agent does not provide tools for writing or testing code; quality assurance features are out of scope."
  },
  "creative_multimodal_exploration": {
    "rating": 2,
    "reasoning": "While ACT-1 observes the visual interface of applications, it is primarily focused on task execution rather than creative generation across modalities."
  },
  "data_experimental_flexibility": {
    "rating": 3,
    "reasoning": "The agent can manipulate data in existing tools like spreadsheets or web forms, but it lacks native features for data experimentation or pipeline management."
  },
  "visual_no_code_development": {
    "rating": 3,
    "reasoning": "Users can automate workflows through natural language without writing code, yet customization and control remain limited."
  },
  "workflow_agent_orchestration": {
    "rating": 4,
    "reasoning": "ACT-1 can carry out multi-step procedures across different applications, demonstrating strong cross-tool orchestration, although it currently operates as a single agent."
