# SWE-agent (Open SWE)

## Overview

Open SWE (formerly SWE-agent) is an open-source, asynchronous, cloud-hosted coding agent from LangChain. It is designed to operate like another engineer on your team, with the ability to research a codebase, create a detailed execution plan, write code, run tests, review its own work, and open a pull request when it's finished.

## Key Features

- Open-source, asynchronous, cloud-hosted coding agent.
- Connects directly to GitHub repositories.
- Can research a codebase, create a detailed execution plan, write code, run tests, review its own work, and open a pull request.
- Human-in-the-loop for plan approval.
- Runs in an isolated sandbox.
- Uses a multi-agent architecture with Manager, Planner, and Programmer/Reviewer agents.

## Supported Models

Open SWE uses Claude models and requires an Anthropic API key to run.
