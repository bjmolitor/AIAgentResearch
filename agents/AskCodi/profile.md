# AskCodi

## Overview

AskCodi is a developer productivity platform from Assistiv AI. It combines a web-based playground with IDE extensions to help developers generate, refactor, and test code across many languages. The service includes specialized generators for documentation, infrastructure files, and even SQL or regex snippets, letting users offload repetitive work to the assistant.

Launched by Assistiv AI in 2021, AskCodi aims to streamline day-to-day programming tasks rather than replace developers. It taps into models from multiple providers so that users can choose between speed and quality, and it exposes most features through both the web app and editor plugins.

## Key Features

- AI coding assistant with a wide range of tools, including a code generator, refactorer, fixer, and translator.
- Can write Makefiles, queries, regex, and unit tests.
- Has a CI/CD pipeline writer, Dockerfile writer, and Kubernetes writer.
- Includes a Big-O analyzer, bug detector, and code explainer.
- Has a sandbox for building and testing front-end code.
- Integrates with VS Code, JetBrains, and Sublime Text.

## Integrations and Workflow

AskCodi offers official extensions for Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, and Sublime Text. These plugins expose the full suite of generators directly inside the editor and can pull context from open files to improve suggestions. The web sandbox, called **Codi Web**, provides a multi-file workspace for quick experiments and includes one-click export to GitHub. AskCodi also supplies a browser extension for generating code from documentation pages and an API for custom integrations.
