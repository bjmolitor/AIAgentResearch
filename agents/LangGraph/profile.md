# LangGraph

## Overview

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of (and intended to be used with) LangChain. It extends the LangChain Expression Language with the ability to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclical manner.

## Key Information

- **Website:** [https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)
- **Developer:** LangChain, Inc.
- **Pricing Model:** Open-Source
- **Supported Models:** As LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem, it supports a wide variety of models, including those from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and many others.

## Key Features

- **Reliability and Controllability:** Steer agent actions with moderation checks and human-in-the-loop approvals. LangGraph persists context for long-running workflows, keeping your agents on course.
- **Low-level and Extensible:** Build custom agents with fully descriptive, low-level primitives free from rigid abstractions that limit customization. Design scalable multi-agent systems, with each agent serving a specific role tailored to your use case.
- **First-class Streaming Support:** With token-by-token streaming and streaming of intermediate steps, LangGraph gives users clear visibility into agent reasoning and actions as they unfold in real time.

## Benchmarks

No specific benchmark data is available for LangGraph itself, as it is a framework for building agents. The performance on benchmarks like SWE-bench would depend on the specific agent implementation.

## Qualitative Assessment

- **Ease of Use:** The documentation provides a comprehensive tutorial series to guide users through the process of building a chatbot, suggesting a focus on user-friendly design.
- **Documentation Quality:** The documentation is well-structured, with clear explanations, tutorials, and examples.
- **Onboarding Experience:** The "Learn LangGraph basics" tutorial series serves as the primary onboarding path, offering a step-by-step introduction to the framework's key features.
