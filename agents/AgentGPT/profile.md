# AgentGPT

AgentGPT is an open-source platform that lets users assemble and launch autonomous AI agents directly from a web browser. After naming an agent and giving it a goal, the system breaks the objective into tasks, executes them, and iterates on results automatically. The project is developed by Reworkd and is available on GitHub.

## Key Features
- Browser-based interface for configuring and deploying GPT agents
- Goal-oriented task generation and execution
- Open-source code with support for user-provided API keys
