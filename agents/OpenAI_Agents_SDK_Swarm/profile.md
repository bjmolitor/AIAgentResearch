# OpenAI Agents SDK (Swarm)

## Overview

OpenAI Agents SDK (formerly Swarm) is a lightweight Python framework for building multi-agent applications. It provides minimalist building blocks—agents, tools, handoffs, and guardrails—to orchestrate autonomous LLM workflows.

## Key Information

- **Developer:** OpenAI
- **Website:** [https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/)
- **Pricing:** Open-source MIT license; cost is usage of underlying model APIs.

## Key Features

- **Multi-agent orchestration:** Define agents with instructions and tools, then pass control via handoffs.
- **Guardrails:** Configurable input and output validation for safer agent behavior.
- **Session management:** Automatic conversation history across runs.
- **Tracing UI:** Built-in tracing and debugging for agent workflows.
- **Provider-agnostic:** Works with OpenAI models and 100+ other LLMs via LiteLLM.

## Supported Models

Supports OpenAI Responses and Chat Completions APIs, including GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and over 100 other models through LiteLLM.

## Pricing Model

Released under the MIT license and free to use; users pay only for the model and infrastructure resources their agents consume.

## Benchmarks

No public benchmark scores are available.

## Qualitative Assessment

- **Ease of Use:** 3/5 – Minimalistic API but requires Python development.
- **Documentation Quality:** 4/5 – Comprehensive README and docs site.
