The agent is designed to independently carry out complex real-world tasks without direct or continuous human guidance. It is recognized as one of the world's first autonomous agents capable of independent thinking, dynamic planning, and decision-making.  The official launch of Manus was on March 6, 2025. It was described as a major advance because it could autonomously handle complex tasks, including writing and deploying code."
