## Description

WebDev Arena is a benchmark that evaluates models’ ability to program web applications according to specific requests. Unlike traditional benchmarks with a consistent set of questions that models are evaluated on, WebDev Arena allows users to simultaneously have two models produce an application based on the user’s and select the output that they prefer. The WebDev Arena scores update very frequently as people adjudicate the matches.

The models have access to and are instructed to use Next.js, a popular Javascript framework, to create their applications.

The score is calculated using the Bradley-Terry model, which yields a score for a model based on its performance in match-ups against other models in the pool.
