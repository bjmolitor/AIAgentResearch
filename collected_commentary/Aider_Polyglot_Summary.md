# Aider Polyglot Summary

- **Source:** [Epoch AI Benchmarking Hub](https://epoch.ai/benchmarks)
- **Leaderboard:** The link to the official leaderboard (https://aider.chat/leaderboard) is currently returning a 404 error.

## Description

The Aider Polyglot benchmark evaluates models’ coding abilities across C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Rust through 225 of Exercism’s most challenging problems. Models are given two attempts to solve each problem; if they fail the first attempt, they are shown the results of unit tests from their first attempt. This tests how good models are at solving programming problems as well as their ability to edit files and correct their mistakes.

## Agents Mentioned

The `epoch.ai` page does not list specific agents for this benchmark, as it seems the data was intended to be sourced from the now-unavailable leaderboard.
